h1. cockpit module for Puppet

This module provides classes to manage the "Elexis cockpit":https://github.com/elexis/elexis-cockpit/ app.

Installation
Enable plugin synchronization for custom types.  In your puppet.conf (usually in /etc/puppet)
on both the Master and Client ensure you have:

bq.    [main]
       	 pluginsync = true

        
h2. Examples

* To install the cockpit:

bq.    class { "cockpit": }

This sets ensure => present for the package. If you want to set a different
value, you can override the cockpit::params::ensure parameter using hiera.

* To remove the cockpit:

bq.   class { "cockpit": ensure => absent }

* see the files under test for more examples
